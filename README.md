# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance, and Vehicle Weight 
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  
  
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  No, because the R-squared value is 0.7149
