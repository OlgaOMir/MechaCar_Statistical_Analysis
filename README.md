# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance, and Vehicle Weight 
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
the intercept is very close to zero base on the calculations
  
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  No, because the R-squared value is 0.7149


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
